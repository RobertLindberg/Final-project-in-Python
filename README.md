# Final project in Python course
In this project we took sparsematrices (large matrices with atleast 50 % of the entries being 0) and converted them into 3 vectors using compressed sparse rows (CSR) and compressed sparse columns (CSC), then performing computations on those vectors. The advantage of this compared to perfoming computations on the original matrix is faster computation and less memory storage.

This project was a group project, but I've deleted all code that isn't mine.
